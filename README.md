# hello-world
Hello everyone! I am a father, husband, a veteran in both the United States Marines and U.S. Army, a project manager, civil engineer technician, facilities manager, historic preservation carpenter, NAGPRA coordinator, contract specialist and a lifelong student. I am a member of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians. I believe in thinking ahead for the seventh generation, the idea that we should consider how our lives, actions and societies effect on not just the next generation but seven generations from now.
